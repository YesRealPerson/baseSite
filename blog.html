            <h3><span class="date">3/17/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Monterey, California</span></h3>
            Recently I traveled to Monterey for a day. 
            I've been to Monterey several times in the past, however, it's always nice to revist.
            From my experience there are three must-dos in Monterey, visit the aquarium, eat clam chowder, and eat at a restaurant along the Old Fisherman's Wharf.
            Given this, I made sure to do all of these things.
            The aquarium was as pleasant as ever, I don't really have much to say besides it was very enjoyable to walk around and observe.
            I tried to take pictures of some of the exhibits but naturally animals aren't exactly the easiest subjects to control.
            Also, it felt pretty rude to stand in front of the glass for longer than a minute so I couldn't exactly wait for them to get into position.
            I managed to get okay-ish photos of the jellyfish and the aquarium itself but that's it. I'm not the greatest photographer.<br>
            <div class="blogImages">

                <img class="float" src="./IMG/MontereyAquarium.png">
            </div>
            Next on the list, clam chowder, I can't really say anything besides it was great.
            I've tried San Francisco, Boston, Santa Cruz, and Monterey clam chowder and undoubtedly Monterey clam chowder is the best.
            However, the sourdough bread is not nearly as good as San Francisco sourdough.
            Next time I visit I should buy sourdough in San Francisco then buy clam chowder.
            Finally, I ate dinner along the Old Fisherman's Wharf. 
            I ended up eating at a restaurant called Domenico's, it was a decent experience. 
            The ocean view was alright considering it is obstructed by many boats (not at the fault of the restaurant of course), the seafood was fresh as to be expected, and the food itself was enjoyable.
            I'm not a too experienced in the world of criticizing food so all I can say is that I enjoyed the food and I left the restaurant happy.
            <br><br>
            Monterey is pretty cool, I'll come back again soon.

            <h3><span class="date">3/12/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Playing a New Game</span></h3>
            I started playing the game <i>Slave Zero X</i> yesterday, it's pretty fun.
            I've never been very good at keeping up and inputting combos in fighting games and I guess that always led
            to me quickly abandoning them.
            The combos in <i>Slave Zero X</i> are as difficult as any other fighting game for me but I've enjoyed the
            learning curve more.
            I feel like the game being a single-player PVE game allows for this as I am not immediately stomped on by
            other players and I don't feel that there's anything on the line when I lose.
            Playing challenging single-player or PVE games have really been my joy for the past year.
            I've found that PVP games give too much pressure to perform and too much fustration when your teammates
            don't perform.
            I quit most PVP games such as <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>League of Legends</i> (I would've quit anways with
            Vanguard being added soon), I don't think I would go back to either unless a friend asks me to.
            However, I still ocassionally enjoy <i>Destiny 2</i> PVP, I feel it's generally less personal (ignoring the
            comments under my Steam profile), you just go in, get a kill, die, repeat.
            Maybe I'll post something else when I finish <i>Slave Zero X</i> but for now the combat and style of the
            game is great.
            I just wish there was more enemy variety and less "go fight 5000 guys" as the difficulty scalar.
