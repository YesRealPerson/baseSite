            I figured I should write something to this extent since I wrote something for the first month at Berkeley, though to be honest, I don't think I have much to say.
            My initial impressions haven't been really shifted and I'm fairly content with where I ended the semester. 
            I'll look back on this post and find myself very boring, but I think I would understand.
            I was fairly academically successful, I didn't socialize as much as I could've (don't know if I wanted to though), and I found myself a decent spot in professional oriented club.
            <br><br>
            I'll probably do another set of posts in my senior year and hopefully I'll have something more interesting (and introspective) to write about.

            <h3><span class="date">10/19/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Music</span></h3>
            My friend recently convinced me to waste about $200 on <a
                href="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/hd-560s/">Sennheiser HD560s</a> headphones by
            relentlessly talking about how incredible the experience is.
            In his words, "it's like seeing colors," "you won't be able to listen to music any other way," and "it's
            almost exactly like listening to live music."
            The last thing I needed was another money sink hobby in my life but I eventually caved after a few weeks,
            and while I will say he was overexaggerating, I don't think I can say by much.
            I don't regret buying these headphones whatsoever. There's a depth to most music that I think I haven't
            really heard in headphones before.
            I would imagine it's like the difference between a digital piano and a physical piano; there's just some
            nuance to the sound that's lost.

            <h3><span class="date">9/29/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">First Month</span></h3>
            I guess it's more like first month and a week but does it really matter?
            <br><br>
            <br>I thought I should write some thoughts about my first month at UC Berkeley so here they are.
            <br><br>Classes have been for the most part reasonable, I performed fairly alright on my very first set of
            midterms and I am feeling pretty good for the rest of the semester. The content isn't too crazy but I
            definitely need to put in the work. The professors are normal for the most part but somewhat eccentric at
            times (Babak Ayazifar), but they're all ultimately pretty inspiring to listen to (Peter Hurtubise
            from the sociology deptarment).
            <br><br>Campus itself is really beautiful, I took a lot of pictures early in the semester I'll probably
            upload
            them sometime later in the year along with some others. For now have a picture I took of the campanile.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/campanile.jpg">
            </div>
            <br><br>The city of Berkeley itself is generally lively and enjoyable. The buildings are pretty and the
            streets are
            mostly clean, it's pretty fun to just walk around town.
            <br><br>The food served in the dining halls ranges from disgusting to just alright, I don't understand how
            one of
            the best universities in the world can serve such bad food. Below is some dry and old tasting salmon with
            some other bland foods on the side. I feel as if I literally just eat nutrient cardboard every day.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/garbage.png">
            </div>
            <br>However, the food outside of the dining halls is really good. Below is some chicken teriyaki from Aki's
            Japanese which was pretty good and a great amount of food for the price (especially in Berkeley).
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/akisjapanese.jpg">
            </div>
            <br>The homeless people are something of a problem but so far they've mainly been annoyances more than
            anything hopefully that never escalates (got called a yellow-skinned bitch once).
            Although I do really like the crazies who just do nothing but yell about the shadow government coming to get
            you. I think they're neat.
            <br><br>The people at Berkeley can be really nice and can be very tedious to talk to. What I mean is the
            people in EECS
            have for the most part been very difficult to talk to, it's always consulting clubs, projects, and
            internships with
            them; can't they talk about anything other than being successful? There are few exceptions to this rule it
            feels like, I think I'll have a good chance at finding these exceptions in smaller coding clubs but I'll
            have to see.
            On the other hand, outside of EECS the people are generally very nice and I hope to make some more friends
            soon. On
            a side note, the few friends I made in orientation have mostly fallen away which saddens me but I guess
            that's
            sort of to be expected for people outside of your major.
            <br><br>
            I would say these are all the thoughts that have really come to mind when thinking back on my first month,
            maybe I'll make another entry like this at the end of the semester, I'm sure it'll be fun for me to read this
            entry in a few months.

            <h3><span class="date">7/3/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Japan</span></h3>
            Recently I traveled to Japan for about a week.
            Like many other people my age, Japan's cultural exports left me with a great desire to one day visit the
            country
            (in all honesty not sure if I'm using that term right but it makes sense as a way to describe it in my
            head).
            Overall, the trip was great with the only complaints coming from my legs after essentially speedrunning most
            major tourist spots in Japan.<br><br>
            Day zero (the day I landed so not really a day) was very relaxed with a few main objectives: get out of the
            airport, get to the hotel, eat something, sleep, this is effectively what happened. However, that does not
            mean
            I have nothing to say about day zero. My first impressions of the country started the second I got into a
            taxi,
            in the backseat behind the passengers side (which is on the left instead of the right), there was a screen
            with
            advertisements playing. This interested me as, in my opinion, one very easy way to determine the current
            cultural priorities of a country is to observe what things and how things are advertised. Nearly every ad
            was in
            a corporate setting and displayed some underlying meaning of "this will increase productivity." There were
            the
            essential corporate solutions ads but even things like ads for taxi services or stomach ache medicine were
            in
            the context of, "being the smarter more efficient worker for using the taxi app" or "you can work so much
            better
            if you feel better." I cannot read or speak Japanese with any fluency but even this was immediately clear to
            me;
            from my snapshot in Japan, the idea of an intense work culture is very real. Beyond this there was the city
            itself, the city is huge, it felt endless. In cities like San Francisco or New York I felt as if it was
            conceivable to leave the city on foot, but in Tokyo it was as if I could walk for that entire week and still
            be
            surrounded by nothing but skyscrapers. Additionally, it never felt as if I had ever "moved districts." What
            I
            mean is that the city felt so consistent, while you could tell if you were in a richer area, it was as if
            there
            was an unbreakable floor for the base quality for any part of the city. I am sure that anyone who has
            actually
            lived in the city could tell you exactly how wrong that statement is in reality but as a tourist it was like
            I
            only knew I had moved a great distance in the city because I was in a moving car for 30 minutes. First
            impressions aside the day progressed beyond my taxi ride, into dinner which was a 7-11 "egg sando" (a
            sandwich),
            and into the first real day.
            <br><br>
            Day one was a day spent in Shibuya. Due to jet-lag I and the person I was traveling with awoke early in the
            morning. We decided to spend the morning walking around aimlessly getting to know the area we were in
            (although
            she never actually learned). We ended up walking all the way to Tokyo Tower and discovering all of our local
            metro stations.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/tokyotower.jpg">
            </div><br>
            As we explored our local station we discovered that Suica cards (the local metro pass) was no longer being
            sold
            at minor stations. Everyone else with me on that trip was an iPhone user so they had no problem using Apple
            Pay
            to use the transit system, I thought this was nothing more than a minor setback as I would just buy a
            physical
            one at a station however, this derailed that plan. We returned to the hotel where I did research and
            discovered
            they could possibly be purchased at the major stations such as Shibuya, Tokyo, and Haneda International
            Airport
            (god damn it). For our trip to Shibuya I used the ticket system which while not convenient felt so efficient
            for
            some reason (if mobile pay and IC cards didn't exist I don't think I would've minded at all using the ticket
            system). Shibuya was mostly spent shopping, finding all of our favorite Japanese products from Pokemon to
            Uniqlo
            clothes. I unfortunately started what would be a habit of rolling a couple gacha machines every day
            (probably
            adding upwards of five to seven thousand yen over the course of the trip) and rolled for a few toys at the
            Pokemeon center, I ended up getting a windswept Yamper and a Spheal keychain (I love him).
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/mewtwo.jpg">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/shibuyacrossing.jpg">
            </div><br>
            For lunch we visited Ichiran Ramen, it was probably some of the best ramen I had eaten, I'm not a food
            critic so
            I can't really put into words what made it so special but it was better (and much cheaper) than any shop I
            had
            visited in the US. I really loved how customizable every part of the dish was on the ordering ticket.
            <br><br> Beyond this nothing really of note happened that day, we enjoyed our time exploring, getting lost,
            shopping, and eating in Shibuya but nothing else worth dedicating to writing.
            <br><br>
            Day two was spent at Tsukiji (fish market) and Akihabara (electric town). Our main goal for that day was to
            get
            a reservation at the renowned Sushi Dai restaurant in the fish market. We arrived at 7 AM which was barely
            on
            time for a reservation for four about four hours later. From my understanding we got one of the last
            reservations possible that day. We naively thought we were going to be able to get a reservation for around
            breakfast (maybe 8 or 8:30) but that ended up falling through so we ate breakfast at a neighboring
            restaurant.
            The food wasn't anything exceptional and was one of the more expensive meals we ordered during this trip (at
            about 5000 yen or $30 per person), we very much fell into a tourist trap (probably meant for those who
            failed to
            get a reservation at Sushi Dai). To further pass the time, we explored the surrounding market area. The
            building
            itself had many areas where you could peer into the lower market and read some random facts about the
            building
            or fish. We ultimately made our way up the building, to a small market for souvenirs, groceries, and other
            oddities, and then to the roof which had a small garden and walking path. It was mostly empty since it was
            raining so we had a great time walking around by ourselves up there. Next, we made our way down to a
            separate
            market area, we really just walked through since we didn't want to stand around due to the rain, however, we
            did
            buy candied strawberries which were <em>really</em> good.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/tsukijiview.jpg">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/tsukijimarket.jpg">
            </div><br>
            This ate up just enough time for us to return to Sushi Dai and have some of the best sushi of our lives for
            a
            comparatively affordable price. The meal consisted of nine curated dishes of sushi along with one tenth dish
            of
            your choice. Additionally, a raw-fish-less option was offered for a slightly higher price which was great
            for
            one of us. It was really delicious, like a said before I am not a critic but it tasted like the sushi I know
            but
            raised up to eleven in terms of flavor. At only ~5000 yen per person (~$31) it was easily one of (if not)
            the
            best price to enjoyment meals I've had in the past year. I think I might need to go back to Japan just to
            eat
            there again.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/sushidai.jpg">
            </div><br>
            After this our group split so I could head to Akihabara to find some Gundams and explore what is effectively
            nerd central. I walked from building to building and bought some anime merchandise (mostly Studio Ghibli
            stuff
            like keychains and small plush toys), and people watched. I eventually ended up in an arcade where I saw
            some
            guy going absolutely crazy on a Taiko drum game (Taiko no Tatsujin), he brought his own sticks and was being
            flashy at every larger opportunity between notes, absolutely inspirational. I ended my small journey by
            visiting
            several gundam stores and bought a couple kits and a pair of nippers (apparently Japanese knives and tools
            are
            really exceptional and after using them I guess they're better but it could just be that my old nippers were
            just really old).
            <br><br>
            Day three was a travel day, we made way to Kyoto by the bullet train (shinkansen) and resettled in a new
            hotel.
            I walked around for a bit and I took a picture of a street.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/kyotostreet.jpg">
            </div><br>
            I explored around Kyoto a small amount around our hotel but ultimately took most of the day to rest. We ate
            some
            pretty good tsukemen (dipping) ramen and called it a day.
            <br><br>
            Day four we visited Osaka and Universal Studios Japan. We were mostly in Universal Japan to see a few main
            attractions we couldn't find in America and Super Nintendo World. We began by visiting the My Hero Academia
            ride
            since it was literally at the front of the park, it was a thing I guess. I stopped reading the manga about a
            year ago now and I'm not sure what I really expected but it really was a nothing burger of a ride. Next, we
            walked around waiting for our reservation to enter Super Nintendo World. I found a funny USPS box with a
            couple
            typos on the small box most notably the misspelling Sunday as Sunrday.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/uspsfunny.jpg">
            </div><br>
            We also found San Francisco land so we ended up back in California in Japan which was funny, and walked into
            Despicable Me land. Japan must really love minions or something. Since the single rider line was really
            short
            for the Despicable Me ride we decided to have a shot at it. It was identical to the one in Hollywood except
            for
            the fact that you are in a car with a roof that I was very evidently too tall for and nearly got kicked off
            for
            as the ride operator very clearly was not sure what exactly to do about the situation and moved me several
            times
            before essentially just saying screw it and put me in the ride. Eventually we made our way into Super
            Nintendo
            World and it was really cool, theme parks that can really immerse you into a world are great and bar the
            cloudy
            day the designers at Universal Japan really knocked it out of the park with that section.
            <br>
            <div class="blogImages">
                <img class="float" src="./IMG/nintendoworld.jpg">
            </div><br>
            We rode the Mario Kart ride which was interesting but nothing I want to specifically write about, got stuck
            in a
            gift shop, took a few pictures, and left the area. Following this we rode the Hollywood dream rollercoaster
            which was just a rollercoaster but like any rollercoaster it was fun and thrilling, just nothing
            exceptional. We
            ultimately decided to leave after this as most other rides we either weren't interested in or had some
            equivalent in California. This led us to Osaka proper where we visited the quintessential tourist spots such
            as
            the Ebisubashi bridge (the place with the funny Gilco sign) and Dotonbori where we ate some good Takoyaki.
            Similarly to Akihabara and Shibuya we walked around, shopped, and people watched before ultimately returning
            to
            the hotel.

            Day five was spent exploring a temple and making our way back to Tokyo. We walked up to the Kiyomizudera
            temple
            which was really pretty to look at and had a great view of nature and Kyoto itself.

            It was really enjoyable to be in a bit more a of a serene place for once in the trip (ignoring the massive
            crowd
            of people). However, we didn't spend too much time there as we headed back to the hotel to check out and
            board
            the train back to Tokyo soon after. We checked back into the same hotel we were originally staying at and I
            headed back out to look around Tokyo again. At this point I was pretty good at making my way around the city
            and
            went to the Tokyo City View atop Roppongi Hills in time to watch the sun set.
            <br><br>
            Day six was the last full day in Japan we headed to the Senso-ji temple, as well as the Tokyo Skytree area.
            The
            temple itself was pretty and well maintained with small gardens and shops surrounding it. I enjoyed walking
            around reading various signs describing the history of the temple, the English translations were very
            appreciated. In addition to the sights I pulled a fortune and got a bad fortune. Hopefully it's all just
            superstition. There also was a monkey performing acrobatics which was entertaining but also sad as the
            monkey
            did not seem very happy to be there.

            </div><br>
            After this we left to go to the Skytree, however, we did not actually go up as there was a sizable line to
            enter
            so we decided to stay in the surrounding mall area. Inside the mall we found a Kirby Cafe as well as an
            exposition for the Chiba Institute of Technology. The exposition was split into two main portitions, the
            first
            had some very cool robotics projects were on display as well as a few computer vision projects which drew a
            much
            larger crowd than any of the other exhibits, the second displayed several satellite parts and models as well
            as
            a near life-size gundam model. We spent a couple hours walking around the Skytree Town area but ultimately
            nothing else I'd want to write down really occurred.

            This trip was really quite fun and I would want to return some time in the future just to enjoy the country
            again in a less rushed way. This is by far the longest entry into this blog thus far. While this entry is
            mostly
            just here to act as a reminder to myself of this very enjoyable trip.

            Random thought since I haven't done anything to this page in a while.<br>
            I think I have a caffeine addiction, I've spent way too much money on coffee within the past month. I've
            spent
            too many nights working recently. I should take a break.

            <h3><span class="date">3/17/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Monterey, California</span></h3>
            Recently I traveled to Monterey for a day.
            I've been to Monterey several times in the past, however, it's always nice to revisit.
            From my experience there are three must-dos in Monterey, visit the aquarium, eat clam chowder, and eat at a
            restaurant along the Old Fisherman's Wharf.
            Given this, I made sure to do all of these things.
            The aquarium was as pleasant as ever, I don't really have much to say besides it was very enjoyable to walk
            around and observe.
            I tried to take pictures of some of the exhibits but naturally animals aren't exactly the easiest subjects
            to
            control.
            Also, it felt pretty rude to stand in front of the glass for longer than a minute so I couldn't exactly wait
            for
            them to get into position.
            I managed to get okay-ish photos of the jellyfish and the aquarium itself but that's it. I'm not the
            greatest
            photographer.<br>
            <div class="blogImages">

                <img class="float" src="./IMG/MontereyAquarium.png">
            </div>
            Next on the list, clam chowder, I can't really say anything besides it was great.
            I've tried San Francisco, Boston, Santa Cruz, and Monterey clam chowder and undoubtedly Monterey clam
            chowder is
            the best.
            However, the sourdough bread is not nearly as good as San Francisco sourdough.
            Next time I visit I should buy sourdough in San Francisco then buy clam chowder.
            Finally, I ate dinner along the Old Fisherman's Wharf.
            I ended up eating at a restaurant called Domenico's, it was a decent experience.
            The ocean view was alright considering it is obstructed by many boats (not at the fault of the restaurant of
            course), the seafood was fresh as to be expected, and the food itself was enjoyable.
            I'm not a too experienced in the world of criticizing food so all I can say is that I enjoyed the food and I
            left the restaurant happy.
            <br><br>
            Monterey is pretty cool, I'll come back again soon.

            <h3><span class="date">3/12/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Playing a New Game</span></h3>
            I started playing the game <i>Slave Zero X</i> yesterday, it's pretty fun.
            I've never been very good at keeping up and inputting combos in fighting games and I guess that always led
            to me quickly abandoning them.
            The combos in <i>Slave Zero X</i> are as difficult as any other fighting game for me but I've enjoyed the
            learning curve more.
            I feel like the game being a single-player PVE game allows for this as I am not immediately stomped on by
            other players and I don't feel that there's anything on the line when I lose.
            Playing challenging single-player or PVE games have really been my joy for the past year.
            I've found that PVP games give too much pressure to perform and too much frustration when your teammates
            don't perform.
            I quit most PVP games such as <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>League of Legends</i> (I would've quit anyways with
            Vanguard being added soon), I don't think I would go back to either unless a friend asks me to.
            However, I still occasionally enjoy <i>Destiny 2</i> PVP, I feel it's generally less personal (ignoring the
            comments under my Steam profile), you just go in, get a kill, die, repeat.
            Maybe I'll maken entry when I finish <i>Slave Zero X</i> but for now the combat and style of the
            game is great.
            I just wish there was more enemy variety and less "go fight 5000 guys" as the difficulty scalar.
