            <h3><span class="date">3/12/24</span> | <span class="blogTitle">Playing a New Game</span></h3>
            I started playing the game <i>Slave Zero X</i> yesterday, it's pretty fun.
            I've never been very good at keeping up and inputting combos in fighting games and I guess that always led
            to me quickly abandoning them.
            The combos in <i>Slave Zero X</i> are as difficult as any other fighting game for me but I've enjoyed the
            learning curve more.
            I feel like the game being a single-player PVE game allows for this as I am not immediately stomped on by
            other players and I don't feel that there's anything on the line when I lose.
            Playing challenging single-player or PVE games have really been my joy for the past year.
            I've found that PVP games give too much pressure to perform and too much fustration when your teammates
            don't perform.
            I quit most PVP games such as <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>League of Legends</i> (I would've quit anways with
            Vanguard being added soon), I don't think I would go back to either unless a friend asks me to.
            However, I still ocassionally enjoy <i>Destiny 2</i> PVP, I feel it's generally less personal (ignoring the
            comments under my Steam profile), you just go in, get a kill, die, repeat.
            Maybe I'll post something else when I finish <i>Slave Zero X</i> but for now the combat and style of the
            game is great.
            I just wish there was more enemy variety and less "go fight 5000 guys" as the difficulty scalar.
